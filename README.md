# HappyDiffusion FX 7 - Ultra-Realistic Stable Diffusion Model

HappyDiffusion FX is the default model developed for [HappyDiffusion.com](https://www.happydiffusion.com), focused on generating ultra realistic images.

## Features

- **Ultra-Realism:** We have carefully handpicked and merged over 200 realistic models on Civitai to create HappyDiffsuion FX. 

- **Meticulously Trained:** We've put in considerable effort, testing hundreds of prompts to ensure the best possible outcomes. After going through 6 iterations, we have learned how to perfectly train the model to achieve images that look lifelike.

- **Extensively Refined:** A lot of labor of love has been put into refining the final results and training the model.


## License
This model is licesed under CreativeML OpenRAIL-M license. However, there are only a few simple rules we'd ask you to adhere to:

- Always use the name of the model in any generation service which is "HappyDiffusion FX 7"

- Do not change the name or obfuscate it.
