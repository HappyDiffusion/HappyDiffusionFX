- **Ultra-Realism:** We have carefully handpicked and merged over 200 realistic models on Civitai to create HappyDiffsuion FX. 

- **Meticulously Trained:** We've put in considerable effort, testing hundreds of prompts to ensure the best possible outcomes. After going through 6 iterations, we have learned how to perfectly train the model to attain images that look lifelike.
